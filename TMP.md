The estimates slightly lag today's combined volumes due to the expected introduction of a more affordable MacBook variant based on an iPhone-class processor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kuo emphasized that the order size is modest and will not meaningfully disrupt <strong>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd&#8217;s</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/TSM\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"ticker-link\" data-ticker=\"TSM\" data-exchange=\"NYSE\" rel=\"noopener\">(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/TSM\">TSM</a>)</a> moat. Still, he argued the strategic signal is substantial for both companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analyst noted Apple needs a second advanced-node supplier to strengthen supply-chain resiliency, even while it continues relying heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also noted the Intel partnership aligning with U.S. industrial policy priorities, including Trump-era \"Made in USA\" initiatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kuo viewed securing Apple's business as a milestone that could redefine confidence in Intel Foundry Services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Intel remains technologically behind Taiwan Semiconductor, Kuo says this win suggests its worst period may be ending and opens the door for future Apple orders — potentially on the 14A node and beyond — as well as business from other top-tier customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>INTC Price Action:&nbsp;</strong>INTC stock is up 10.19% at $40.56 at publication on Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/tech/25/11/49051536/taiwan-semiconductor-doubles-down-on-2nm-chips-as-ai-frenzy-fuels-billion-dollar-buildout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Taiwan Semiconductor Doubles Down On 2nm Chips As AI Frenzy Fuels Billion-Dollar Buildout</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Shutterstock</em></p>
